## About AccessRefinery

*AccessRefinery* automatically mines access control intents from IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies. Compared with [AWS Access Analyzer](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_9.pdf), *AccessRefinery* accelerates mining by about 10-100x and reduces the number of intents by up to 10x.

- To accelerate intent mining, *AccessRefinery* uses our Multi-Theory Constraint Preprocessor (*MCP*) to speed up multi-round SMT solving by preprocessing constraints into bit-vector form. We also designed *MCP* as a reusable data structure that may benefit other studies.
- For intent reduction, *AccessRefinery* computes a compact set that covers all mined intents by solving a minimum set-cover problem.

Moreover, the artifact includes the full implementations of *AccessRefinery* and the baseline reimplementation of *Access Analyzer*, along with datasets, archived results, experiment scripts, and plotting scripts to reproduce the results reported in the paper. For technical details, see our [FSE 2026 paper](https://xjtu-netverify.github.io/papers/AccessRefinery/accessrefinery_final_version.pdf).

## Status

We are claiming 3 badges (Functional, Reusable, and Available) under the Artifacts Evaluated and Available sections.

### Evaluated - Functional

We believe this artifact satisfies the Functional criteria based on the following evidence:

- **Documented:** The artifact is well-documented and includes:
  - System requirements
  - Installation instructions
  - Project structure overview
  - Usage examples
  - Reproduction scripts and step-by-step instructions
  - API documentation generated via Javadoc
  - Developer instructions (including running the system in VS Code)

- **Exercisable:** The system can be built and executed from source using standard Maven workflows with JDK 17.

- **Complete:** The artifact includes all necessary components to reproduce the experimental results reported in the paper:
  - Source code of *AccessRefinery*
  - Source code of the reimplemented *Access Analyzer* (used as a baseline, since *AWS Access Analyzer* is not open source and only exposes a CLI interface)
  - Scripts for invoking *AWS Access Analyzer* via CLI
  - Three synthetic datasets (real-world datasets are not publicly available due to commercial restrictions)
  - Reproduction and plotting scripts

- **Consistent with the paper:** The artifact includes archived experimental results and provides instructions to reproduce all key claims reported in the paper.

### Evaluated - Reusable

We believe this artifact satisfies the Reusable criteria for the following reasons:

- **Modular and extensible design:**
  AccessRefinery is designed with clear modular boundaries. In particular, it separates the low-level data structure (*MCP*) from the higher-level analysis tool. This separation enables users to reuse or extend individual components independently.

- **Reusable library (MCP):**
*MCP* is implemented as a standalone Java library. Running `mvn package` generates a reusable JAR file (`mcp-1.0.jar`) that can be directly integrated into other projects.
  - It provides a concise and expressive API (e.g., `policy.not().and(intent1.or(intent2))`).
  - It supports multiple variable types (e.g., regex, prefix, range, and set) through a unified abstraction, making it straightforward to extend to new types.

- **Reusable tool (AccessRefinery):**
  AccessRefinery provides a command-line interface with flexible options for different analysis tasks.
  - Users can easily run experiments or adapt workflows via configurable parameters.
  - The tool supports interchangeable backends (e.g., BDD and SAT solvers), enabling support for additional backends.
  
- **Reusable baseline implementation (Access Analyzer):**
  We provide a reimplementation of *Access Analyzer* as a baseline system for evaluation, since *AWS Access Analyzer* is not open source and only exposes a CLI interface.
  - The reimplementation enables reproducible comparison under a unified experimental framework.
  - The tool supports interchangeable backends (e.g., Z3 and CVC5 solvers), enabling support for additional backends.

- **Ease of extension:**
  The system is designed to facilitate incremental extensions. For example, adding support for new policy languages only requires extending specific components without modifying the entire system.

- **Documentation and examples:**
  The artifact includes API documentation (via Javadoc), usage examples, and instructions, which lower the barrier for reuse and repurposing.

### Available

We believe this artifact satisfies the Available criteria because it is publicly available on Zenodo and GitHub.

## Getting AccessRefinery

For artifact evaluation reviewers, we provide a cloud server that can be accessed via SSH, so **Getting AccessRefinery** and **Installing AccessRefinery** can be skipped.

```shell
ssh ...
... # password
cd accessrefinery
```

- `archive_results/`: Archived experimental results.

## Usages

### Build

In the root directory, run:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

The build generates the following JAR packages in `target/`:

- `mcp-1.0.jar` for *MCP*, which can be reused in other projects for fast multi-round SMT solving.
- `accessrefinery-1.0.jar` for *AccessRefinery*.
- `accessanalyzer-1.0.jar` for the *reimplemented Access Analyzer*.

### Using Multi-Theory Constraint Preprocessor (MCP)

*MCP* is a data structure for fast multi-round SMT solving. It supports regular expressions, IP prefixes/bit-vectors, ranges, and sets.

#### Reuse in Another Project

Install `target/mcp-1.0.jar` into your local Maven repository:

```shell
mvn install:install-file \
    -Dfile=target/mcp-1.0.jar \
    -DgroupId=org.ants \
    -DartifactId=accessrefinery \
    -Dversion=1.0 \
    -Dpackaging=jar \
    -DgeneratePom=true
```

Then add the dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.ants</groupId>
        <artifactId>accessrefinery</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Example

This section illustrates how to use *MCP* with the example in the paper (line 414). Suppose we have the following IAM policy and a target intent, `Intent_6` (`Resource`: `dept*/user1.txt`, `IpAddress`: `112.0.0.0/24`).

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": ["dept*/user1.txt", "dept1/user*.txt"],
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": ["112.0.0.0/24", "113.0.0.0/24"]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "NotResource": "dept1/user*.txt",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "112.0.0.0/24"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "NotResource": "dept*/user1.txt",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp" : "113.0.0.0/24"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To check the satisfiability of three formulas, ¬I6∧P, I6∧¬P, and I6∧P, we use the following code based on *MCP*.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MCPFactory mcp = new MCPFactory(MCPType.BDD);
        mcp.addVar("Res", LabelType.REGEXP, "dept*/user1.txt");
        mcp.addVar("Res", LabelType.REGEXP, "dept1/user*.txt");
        mcp.addVar("IP", LabelType.PREFIX, Prefix.parse("112.0.0.0/24"));
        mcp.addVar("IP", LabelType.PREFIX, Prefix.parse("113.0.0.0/24"));
        mcp.updates();

        MCPBitVector res1 = mcp.getVar("Res", "dept*/user1.txt");
        MCPBitVector res2 = mcp.getVar("Res", "dept1/user*.txt");
        MCPBitVector ip1 = mcp.getVar("IP", Prefix.parse("112.0.0.0/24"));
        MCPBitVector ip2 = mcp.getVar("IP", Prefix.parse("113.0.0.0/24"));
        MCPBitVector s1 = (res1.or(res2)).and(ip1.or(ip2));
        MCPBitVector s2 = res1.not().and(ip1);
        MCPBitVector s3 = res2.not().and(ip2);
        MCPBitVector policy = s1.diff(s2).diff(s3);
        MCPBitVector intent6 = res1.and(ip1);

        // ¬I6∧P is satisfiable.
        Assert.assertTrue(!policy.and(intent6.not()).isZero());
        // I6∧¬P is unsatisfiable.
        Assert.assertTrue(policy.not().and(intent6).isZero());
        // I6∧P is satisfiable.
        Assert.assertTrue(!policy.and(intent6).isZero());
    }
}
```

The code is included in [MCPFactoryTest.java](https://github.com/XJTU-NetVerify/accessrefinery/blob/main/accessrefinery/mcp/src/test/java/org/mcp/core/MCPFactoryTest.java), and *MCP* is imported as a Maven dependency. Running the following command automatically executes this example.

```shell
# The execution takes about 3 minutes.
mvn install
mvn test -pl ./accessrefinery/mcp -Dtest=MCPFactoryTest.java#testMCPFactory
```

Expected output:

```text

### Using AccessRefinery

*AccessRefinery* builds on *MCP* for IAM intent mining and reduction. In this repository, *MCP* is already integrated into *AccessRefinery*, so you can use it directly without a separate installation.

```shell
java -jar target/accessrefinery-1.0.jar [options]
```

Command-line options:

- `-h, --help` : Show help information.
- `-m, --mine` : Enable intent mining.
- `-r, --reduce` : Enable intent reduction.
- `-f, --file <path>` : Input path for policy files (must be under `data/`).
- `-s, --sat` : Use SAT to encode bit-vectors (default is BDD).
- `--round <number>` : Number of mining rounds (to reduce experimental bias).

**Example:**

```shell
java -jar target/accessrefinery-1.0.jar -m -r --round 1 -f data/Correctness
```

Expected output:

```text
[INFO] 2026-04-05 22:51:33 : ----------[ AccessRefinery Mode ]-------------
[INFO] 2026-04-05 22:51:33 : input  path: data/Correctness
[INFO] 2026-04-05 22:51:33 : output path: result/Correctness
[INFO] 2026-04-05 22:51:33 : ----------< 1th policy - 11_allow_allow_equal.json >-----------

[INFO] 2026-04-05 22:51:33 : [2/6]  finish ECs calculation
```

Results are generated in the `result/Correctness/` directory and include:

- `xxx.json`: The intents for each policy.
- `xxx.csv`: Statistics for multi-round SMT solving for each policy.
- `summary.txt`: Summary statistics for all policies in a folder.

In addition, one file is generated in the current path:

- `accessrefinery.log` : Records the running log.

### Using reimplemented Access Analzyer (Baseline)

see [AccessAnalyzerUsage.md](https://github.com/XJTU-NetVerify/accessrefinery/blob/main/docs/AccessAnalyzerUsage.md)

## Running Experiments

This section describes (1) how to reproduce the results in `results/`, and (2) how to reproduce to the corresponding figures, tables, and conclusions in the paper from `results/`.

*We omit the results for the real-world datasets because of commercial restrictions.*

### Reproducing Archived Results

- **Reproducing AccessRefinery Archived Results**

Running with MiniSAT backend takes a long time to run. You can skip it by running the following commands to directly reuse the data in the `archive_results/` directory.

```shell
# skip running AccessRefinery with the MiniSAT backend
mkdir -p results/ 
cp -r archive_results/accessrefinery_sat_*rs results/

# skip running AccessRefinery with the BDD backend
mkdir -p results/ 
cp -r archive_results/accessrefinery_bdd_*rs results/
```

The following scripts invoke `target/accessrefinery-1.0.jar`.

```shell
# The execution takes about 7 minutes.
sh tools/accessrefinery/running_bdd_miner.sh

# The execution takes about 8 minutes.
sh tools/accessrefinery/running_bdd_reducer.sh

# The execution takes about 80 minutes.
sh tools/accessrefinery/running_sat_miner.sh

# The execution takes >12 hours.
sh tools/accessrefinery/running_sat_reducer.sh
```

Expected Output:

- `results/`: All experiments are run for 10 rounds, and average time is reported.

  - `accessrefinery_bdd_miner_10rs/`: intent mining using JavaBDD.
  - `accessrefinery_sat_miner_10rs/`: intent mining using MiniSAT.
  - `accessrefinery_bdd_reducer_10rs/`: intent mining and reduction using JavaBDD.
  - `accessrefinery_sat_reducer_3rs/`: intent mining and reduction using MiniSAT (limited to 3 rounds due to slow execution).

- **Reproducing Reimplemented Access Analyzer Archived Results**

This section takes a long time to run. You can skip it by running the following commands to directly reuse the data in the `archive_results/` directory.

```shell
mkdir -p results/ 
cp -r archive_results/accessanalyzer_*rs results/
```

The following scripts invoke `target/accessanalyzer-1.0.jar`.

```shell
# The execution takes about 5 hours.
bash tools/accessanalyzer-reimpl/mining_miner_cvc5.sh

# The execution takes about 4 hours.
# The time is less than that of AccessRefinery, because of an early timeout.
bash tools/accessanalyzer-reimpl/mining_reducer_cvc5.sh

# The execution takes about 4 hours
bash tools/accessanalyzer-reimpl/mining_miner_z3.sh

# The execution takes about 4 hours
bash tools/accessanalyzer-reimpl/mining_reducer_z3.sh
```

*Note: `Ctrl + C` or `Ctrl + Z` end the scripts*

Expected Output:

- `results/`: All results run for one round due to limited execution time.
  - `accessanalyzer_z3_miner_1rs/`: intent mining using Z3 Solver.
  - `accessanalyzer_cvc5_miner_1rs/`: intent mining using CVC5 Solver.
  - `accessanalyzer_z3_reducer_1rs/`: intent mining and reduction using Z3 Solver.
  - `accessanalyzer_cvc5_reducer_1rs/`: intent mining and reduction using CVC5 Solver.

- **Reproducing AWS Access Analyzer via CLI Archived Results**

Because invoking Access Analyzer via CLI requires a private AWS account, we do not provide this step. However, we still provide scripts for developers; see [AccessAnalyzerCLI.md](https://github.com/XJTU-NetVerify/accessrefinery/blob/main/baselines/accessanalyzer-cli/AccessAnalyzerCLI.md) for details.

 We strongly recommend skipping this step and directly using the results in `archive_results/accessanalyzer_cli/`, since the setup is complex and requires AWS account registration, billing configuration, and CLI credential setup.

```shell
mkdir -p results/
cp -r archive_results/accessanalyzer_cli/ results/accessanalyzer_cli/
```

### Reproducing Claims in the Paper

After generating `results/`, we show how to reproduce the claims in the paper with scripts. 

Before plotting, we recommend clearing previously used plotting data with:

```shell
sh tools/clean_plotting.sh
```
